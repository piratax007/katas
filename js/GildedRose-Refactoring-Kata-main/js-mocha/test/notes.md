- [ ] Should be not possible to make a new "normal item" with quality more than 50
- [X] ~~A normal article can have a sellIn specification greater than the quality value? **YES**, is because passed the
      sellIn, the quality decrease by two~~
- [ ] With an article created with a negative quality value, the updateQuality function give the same negative quality,
      should be possible define a new item using a negative quality value? (that is)
      value, should exist an error in the creation stage?
- [ ] make sense that a new Aged Brie can be defined with negative sellIn and zero quality? why?
- [ ] A new Item should't be defined with a negative sellIn value.
- [ ] If a new item is defined using a quality value greater than 50, should exist an error or should be forced the
      definition of 50 as a max quality value except if the article is sulfuras.
- [ ] should be possible define a new sulfuras item with quality different of 80 (guess NO).
- [ ] should be possible define a new sulfuras item with a negative sellIn (guess NO).
- [ ] the sulfuras item shoul be only _"Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros"_?
- [ ] The backstage new entry, only can be useful if the entry is _"Backstage passes to a TAFKAL80ETC concert"_? (guess NO).
