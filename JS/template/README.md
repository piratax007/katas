# Javascript TDD Skeleton

This is a skeleton project for doing TDD exercises in Javascript. Use `npm install` to install the dependencies of the project.
Then, use `npm test` to run the tests, or `npm run watch` to run mocha in "watch mode" to automatically re-run tests whenever
the source files change.
